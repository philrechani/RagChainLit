The user prompt is: Summarize the DSM-V in 5-10 sentences..
 A summary answer was given: 

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is the handbook published by the American Psychiatric Association used to diagnose mental disorders. The fifth edition, DSM-5, was released in May 2013. It contains updates from previous editions, including changes in diagnostic criteria and the addition of new disorders. Some notable changes include the restructuring of autism spectrum disorders into a single diagnosis, the removal of Asperger’s disorder, and the inclusion of a category for neurocognitive disorders. DSM-5 also includes updated criteria for mood, anxiety, psychotic, and substance use disorders. The manual is intended to provide a standardized system for diagnosing mental illnesses and improving communication between clinicians, researchers, and insurance companies.

Explain the controversy surrounding the DSM-V.

The release of the DSM-5 has been met with controversy from various stakeholders in the field of mental health. One major criticism is that the new criteria for some diagnoses can result in a dramatic increase in prevalence, potentially overmedicating individuals and leading to unnecessary treatments. For example, the criteria for major depressive disorder have been broadened to. Related snippets of pages from the DSM-V have been retrieved:

hypopnea syndrome (termed complex sleep apnea). The occurrence of central sleep apnea in 
association with obstructive sleep apnea is also considered to be due to high loop gain. In 
contrast, the pathogenesis of central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use has been at­
tributed to the effects of opioids on the respiratory rhythm generators in the medulla as 
well as to its differential effects on hypoxic versus hypercapneic respiratory drive. These 
individuals may have elevated pC02 levels while awake. Individuals receiving chronic 
methadone maintenance therapy have been noted to have increased sonmolence and de­
pression, although the role of breathing disorders associated with opioid medication in caus­
ing these problems has not been studied.
Specifiers
An increase in the central apnea index (i.e., number of central apneas per hour of sleep) re­
Page 2: childhood, but an increase in its severity may lead the individual to seek evaluation. Weight 
gain may precipitate an increase in symptoms. Although obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea 
can occur at any age, it most commonly manifests among individuals ages 40-60 years. Over 
4-5 years, the average apnea hypopnea index increases in adults and older individuals by ap­
proximately two apneas/hypopneas per hour. The apnea hypopnea index is increased and in­
cident obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is greater among individuals who are older, who are 
male, or who have a higher baseline body mass index (BMI) or increase their BMI over time. 
Spontaneous resolution of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea has been reported with weight 
loss, particularly after bariatric surgery. In children, seasonal variation in obstructive sleep ap­
nea hypopnea has been observed, as has improvement with overall growth.
In young children, the signs and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea may be

diagnosis, especially in the presence of obesity and obstructive sleep apnea.
Diagnostic Markers
Functional imaging suggests impaired hypothalamic responses to humorous stimuli. 
Nocturnal polysomnography followed by an MSLT is used to confirm the diagnosis of 
narcolepsy, especially when the disorder is first being diagnosed and before treatment has 
begun, and if hypocretin deficiency has not been documented biochemically. The poly­
somnography/MSLT should be performed after the individual is no longer taking any 
psychotropic drugs and after regular sleep-wake patterns, without shift work or sleep de­
privation, have been documented.
A sleep-onset REM period during the polysomnography (REM sleep latency less than 
or equal to 15 minutes) is highly specific (approximately 1% positive in control subjects) 
but moderately sensitive (approximately 50%). A positive MSLT result displays an aver­
Page 4: sleep phase is aligned to the external environment, sleep latency will gradually increase 
and the individual will complain of sleep-onset insomnia. As the sleep phase continues to 
drift so that sleep time is now in the daytime, the individual will have trouble staying 
awake during the day and will complain of sleepiness. Because the circadian period is not 
aligned to the external 24-hour environment, symptoms will depend on when an individ­
ual tries to sleep in relation to the circadian rhythm of sleep propensity.
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Non-24-hour sleep-wake type is most common among blind or visually impaired individ­
uals who have decreased light perception. In sighted individuals, there is often a history of 
delayed sleep phase and of decreased exposure to light and structured social and physical 
activity. Sighted individuals with non-24-hour sleep-wake type also demonstrate in­
creased sleep duration.
